# Mujollari_Liao_Mutua_Hoxha_EDE_Final_Project

## Summary

This study aims to understand the relationship between renewable energy generation and air quality in the United States. Due to the constraints of Git uploaded file size, we can not upload all the raw data to the shared repository. This repository is thus mainly used to store the processed data, code used in all stages from data wrangling to analysis, and the project output in the form of a final report.

air pollutant, air quality, renewable generation, solar, wind


## Database Information

This analysis uses three databases: EPA Air Quality System (<https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Daily>), EIA-860 (<https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/>), and EIA-923 (<https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/>).
We collected air quality summary statistics by criteria pollutants and location data from the EPA Air Quality System (AQS). The data is available from 1980 to 2021. Power plant generator level capacities and locations are retrieved from EIA-860, and monthly and annual energy generation of power plants is collected from EIA-923. EIA data covers the year from 2001 to 2021. Due to the file size limitations, we were unable to upload the raw data to the Git repository. Nonetheless, we have uploaded the processed data files that were used for further analysis.
For details of each database, please refer to the files in the Metadata folder under the Data folder.
