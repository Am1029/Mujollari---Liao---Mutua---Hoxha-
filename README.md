## Summary

This study aims to understand the relationship between renewable energy generation and air quality. Due to the constraints of Git uploaded file size, we can not upload all the raw data to the shared repository. This repository is thus mainly used to upload processed data and edit project output together.

air pollutant, air quality, renewable generation, solar, wind


## Database Information

This analysis uses three databases: EPA Air Quality System, EIA-860, and EIA-923.
We collected air quality summary statistics by criteria pollutants and location data from the EPA Air Quality System (AQS). The data is available from 1980 to 2021. Power plant generator level capacities and locations are retrieved from EIA-860, and monthly and annual energy generation of power plants is collected from EIA-923. EIA data covers the year from 2001 to 2021.
For details of each database, please refer to the files in the Metadata folder under the Data folder.


## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions
